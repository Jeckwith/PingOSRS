If you enjoyed using my free software, or have any complaints, suggestions,
or other comments, please email me at jbeckwi2@slu.edu, or message me on reddit
at /u/60k_risk. Thank you very much!

How to use:

	1) Double click on the executable BAT file named "ping"
	It is a batch file that will run for a few moments. It will close or notify you when it is done.
	
	2) Double click on the executable JAR file named "PingOSRS"
	This is a JAR file that will generate all of your results into an excel sheet for your viewing.
	
						THIS OUTPUTS UNSORTED DATA INTO AN EXCEL FILE.
						
	3) You should now have two new files in your directory
		- pings.txt
		- PingOutput.xls
		
	4) Open PintOutput.xls - This is an excel file.
	
						IF YOU DO NOT OWN MICROSOFT EXCEL, YOU CAN DOWNLOAD A FREE VERSION
											CALLED OPEN OFFICE!
											
	5) Here you see all of your ping data. 
	
						TO SORT THIS FROM LOW TO HIGH, 
						
						a) select all 71 rows, and both column A and column B. 
						b) Right click and select sort ->  custom sort
						c) choose sort by -> ping
						d) choose sort on -> values
						e) choose order -> Smallest to Largest or A to Z
						f) enjoy!
